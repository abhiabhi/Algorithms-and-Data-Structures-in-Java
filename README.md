# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java

The repo consists of solutions to numerous problems using different data structures and algorithms, all coded in Java. It also
contains solutions to HackerRank problems which I have solved so far and questions from Cracking the Coding Interview 
Book _(6th Edition)_.

You can also refer to my [Java Notes](http://java.ramswaroop.me) for a quick refresh on the Java concepts.
